# Design Pattern with Node.js

1. Singleton Pattern:
Singletons are classes which can be instantiated once, and can be accessed globally. This single instance can be shared throughout our application, which makes Singletons great for managing global state in an application.


Hereâ€™s a complete example of the Singleton pattern in JavaScript:
Example: Singleton Counter Class 
```javascript
class Counter {
    constructor() {
        if (Counter.instance) {
            return Counter.instance; // Return the existing instance if already created
        }
        this.counter = 0; // Initialize the counter
        Counter.instance = this; // Cache the instance
    }
    increment() {this.counter += 1;}
    decrement() {this.counter -= 1;}

    getCount() {return this.counter;}
}

module.exports = new Counter(); // Export the Singleton instance


```

class index.js

```javascript
const counter1 = require('./Counter'); // Import Singleton Counter
const counter2 = require('./Counter'); // Import Singleton Counter again
// Increment using counter1
counter1.increment();
console.log('Counter 1:', counter1.getCount()); // Counter 1: 1
// Increment using counter2 (same instance as counter1)
counter2.increment();
console.log('Counter 2:', counter2.getCount()); // Counter 2: 2
// Decrement using counter1
counter1.decrement();
console.log('Counter 1 after decrement:', counter1.getCount()); // Counter 1 after decrement: 1
console.log('Are counter1 and counter2 the same instance?', counter1 === counter2); // true


```

- The Singleton class ensures only one instance is created by ``` caching the instance ```. 

- The Shared instance  maintains a single counter value, which is updated regardless of which reference is used. 

- The singleton ensures that state is consistent across your application and avoids multiple instances unnecessarily consuming resources.


2. Prototype pattern:

Before learning prototype-pattern, we need to learn what is prototype.
Every javaScript object has an internal property callad `[[Prototype]]`. Which points to 
another object or null. the prototype property is used primarily with constructor functions to define properties and methods that should be shared by all instances of objects created using that constructor. 

```javaScript

function Person(name,age){
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}
Person.prototype.greet = function(){
    console.log(`Hi ${this.name} , ${this.age}`)
}
const person1 = new Person('Ruhul',23);
const person2 = new Person('Sakib',34);

person1.greet()
person2.greet()

```
But using class, The prototype is managed behind the scenes, but the concept remains same.
Prototype is useful for performance optimization.
